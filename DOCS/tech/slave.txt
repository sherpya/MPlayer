SLAVE MODE PROTOCOL
-------------------

The -slave option switches on slave mode, in which MPlayer works as a backend
for other programs. Instead of intercepting keyboard events, MPlayer will read
commands separated by a newline (\n) from stdin.

To try slave mode out by hand, run

  mplayer -slave -quiet <movie>

and type slave commands into the console window.

You can also use a FIFO file (named pipe):

  mkfifo </tmp/fifofile>
  mplayer -slave -input file=</tmp/fifofile> <movie>

Most slave mode commands are equivalent to command line options, though not
necessarily under the same name. Detailed descriptions can be found in the
man page.

All commands can be prefixed with one of "pausing ", "pausing_keep ", or
"pausing_toggle ". "pausing " tells MPlayer to pause as soon as possible
after processing the command. "pausing_keep " tells MPlayer to do so only if
it was already in paused mode. "pausing_toggle " tells MPlayer to do so
only if it was not already in paused mode. Please note that "as soon as
possible" can be before the command is fully executed.
As a temporary hack, there is also the _experimental_ "pausing_keep_force "
prefix, with which MPlayer will not exit the pause loop at all.
Like this you can avoid the "frame stepping" effect of "pausing_keep "
but most commands will either not work at all or behave in unexpected ways.
For "set_mouse_pos" and "key_down_event", "pausing_keep_force" is the default
since other values do not make much sense for them.


Various tips and tricks (please help expand it!):

- Try using something like
    pausing_keep_force pt_step 1
    get_property pause
  to switch to the next file. It avoids audio playback starting to play
  the old file for a short time before switching to the new one.
- To ensure the user can't control MPlayer "behind your back" use
  something like -input nodefault-bindings -noconfig all


Available commands ('mplayer -input cmdlist' will print a list):

    fixed while watching the movie.

sub_pos <value> [abs]
    Adjust/set subtitle position.

sub_remove [value]
    If the [value] argument is present and non-negative, removes the subtitle
    file with index [value]. If the argument is omitted or negative, removes
    all subtitle files.

    Display subtitle with index [value]. Turn subtitle display off if
    [value] is -1 or greater than the highest available subtitle index.

    than -1 (forward or backward respectively).
    Supported subtitle sources are -sub options on the command
    line, VOBsubs, DVD subtitles, and Ogg and Matroska text streams.
    This command is mainly for cycling all subtitles, if you want to set
    a specific subtitle, use sub_file, sub_vob, or sub_demux.

    (forward or backward respectively).

sub_vob [value]
    Display subtitle specified by [value] for VOBsubs. The [value] is
    corresponding to ID_VOBSUB_ID values reported by '-identify'.

    (forward or backward respectively).

sub_demux [value]
    Display subtitle specified by [value] for subtitles from DVD or embedded
    in media file. The [value] is corresponding to ID_SUBTITLE_ID values

    If [value] is omitted or less than -1, will cycle all DVD subs or embedded subs
    (forward or backward respectively).

    as a float (e.g. 1.77778 for 16/9), or special value -1 to reset to
    original aspect ratio (ditto if [value] is missing), or special value 0
    to disable automatic movie aspect ratio compensation.
    There might be problems with some video filters.

    Switch to the DVD title with the ID [value]. Cycle through the
    available titles if [value] is omitted or negative.

The following commands are really only useful for OSD menu console mode:

help
    Displays help text, currently empty.

exit
    Exits from OSD menu console. Unlike 'quit', does not quit MPlayer.

hide
    Hides the OSD menu console. Clicking a menu command unhides it. Other
    keybindings act as usual.

run <string>
    Run <string> with properties expanded as shell command. In OSD menu
    console mode stdout and stdin are through the video output driver.
    Property expansion happens in the same way as for osd_show_property_text.
    Note: MPlayer will do property expansion on anything of the form
    ${somevar} before it is passed to the shell.
    This means that you cannot use this syntax for anything you actually
    want the shell to handle, though any other form like $somevar will
    be passed on to and processed by the shell.

    Example:
    run "echo ${filename} ${stream_pos} >> <path_to_file>"

af_eq_set_bands <values>
    Set bands gain in audio equalizer. Se details in manual (-af equalizer).
    Example:
       af_eq_set_bands 11:11:10:5:0:-12:0:5:12:12
