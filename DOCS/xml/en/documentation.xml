<title>How to read this documentation</title>

<para>
If you are a first-time installer: be sure to read everything from here to
the end of the Installation section, and follow the links you will find. If
you have any other questions, return to the <link linkend="toc">Table of
Contents</link> and search for the topic, read the <xref linkend="faq"/>,
or try grepping through the files. Most questions should be answered somewhere
here and the rest has probably already been asked on our
<ulink url="http://www.mplayerhq.hu/design7/mailing_lists.html">mailing lists</ulink>.
Check the
<ulink url="https://lists.mplayerhq.hu/mailman/listinfo">archives</ulink>, there
is a lot of valuable information to be found there.

<chapter id="intro">
<title>Introduction</title>

<para>
<application>MPlayer</application> is a movie player for Linux (runs on
many other Unices, and non-x86 CPUs, see <xref linkend="ports"/>).
It plays most MPEG, VOB, AVI, Ogg/OGM, VIVO, ASF/WMA/WMV, QT/MOV/MP4, FLI, RM,
NuppelVideo, yuv4mpeg, FILM, RoQ, PVA, Matroska files, supported by
many native, XAnim, RealPlayer, and Win32 DLL codecs. You can watch
Video CD, SVCD, DVD, 3ivx, RealMedia, Sorenson, Theora,
and MPEG-4 (DivX) movies, too. Another big
feature of <application>MPlayer</application> is the wide range of
supported output drivers. It works with X11, Xv, DGA, OpenGL, SVGAlib,
fbdev, AAlib, libcaca, DirectFB, but you can use GGI and SDL (and this way all
their drivers) and some low level card-specific drivers (for Matrox, 3Dfx and
Radeon, Mach64, Permedia3) too! Most of them support software or hardware
scaling, so you can enjoy movies in fullscreen.
<application>MPlayer</application> supports displaying through some
hardware MPEG decoder boards, such as the <link linkend="dvb">DVB</link> and
<link linkend="dxr3">DXR3/Hollywood+</link>. And what about the nice big
antialiased shaded subtitles (14 supported types)
with European/ISO 8859-1,2 (Hungarian, English, Czech, etc), Cyrillic, Korean
fonts, and the onscreen display (OSD)?
</para>

<para>
The player is rock solid playing damaged MPEG files (useful for some VCDs),
and it plays bad AVI files which are unplayable with the famous
<application>Windows Media Player</application>.
Even AVI files without index chunk are playable, and you can
temporarily rebuild their indexes with the <option>-idx</option> option, or
permanently with <application>MEncoder</application>, thus enabling
seeking!  As you see, stability and quality are the most important things,
but the speed is also amazing. There is also a powerful filter system for
video and audio manipulation.
</para>

<para>
<application>MEncoder</application> (<application>MPlayer</application>'s Movie
Encoder) is a simple movie encoder, designed to encode
<application>MPlayer</application>-playable movies
AVI/ASF/OGG/DVD/VCD/VOB/MPG/MOV/VIV/FLI/RM/NUV/NET/PVA
to other <application>MPlayer</application>-playable formats (see below).
It can encode with various codecs, like MPEG-4 (DivX4)
(one or two passes), <systemitem class="library">libavcodec</systemitem>,
PCM/MP3/VBR MP3 audio.
